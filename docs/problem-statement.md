# Problem Statement

Enterprise healthcare organizations rely on complex, legacy systems to process operational workflows such as case reviews, documentation analysis, and approvals. These systems often involve manual, time-consuming steps, fragmented data sources, and outdated user interfaces, resulting in increased operational costs, slower turnaround times, and higher risk of human error.

While modern AI technologies can assist with information synthesis and pattern recognition, direct automation without human oversight introduces unacceptable risk in regulated healthcare environments.

This project aims to modernize a representative enterprise workflow by introducing a scalable, web-based system that integrates AI-assisted decision support while preserving human accountability. The system will demonstrate how AI can be safely embedded into real-world enterprise applications to improve efficiency, consistency, and user experience without compromising compliance or trust.

**Out of Scope:**

- Fully autonomous decision-making
- Model training or fine-tuning
- Replacement of human reviewers

# Success Metrics

- Reduce manual document review time per case by 30–50%
- Provide AI-generated summaries with deterministic, explainable outputs
- Maintain human-in-the-loop approval for all decisions
- API response latency under 500ms for non-AI operations
- AI inference latency under 3 seconds
- Zero storage or logging of sensitive personal data in AI prompts
